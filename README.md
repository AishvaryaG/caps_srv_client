As part of a system programming course, this is a simple client/server program. Over the next 3-4 months,
this repository will be updated to make a distributed program which handles large work requests, which it
shares with multiple client threads.

How to run?
-----------

1. Build the server using "make"
2. Run the server using ./caps 

In another window,
1. telnet localhost PORT_NUM, where PORT_NUM is 4444 by default
